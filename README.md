# BLE-CAN Smart Implement Tracker

A complete edge-to-cloud system to track and log farm implement usage in real-time using BLE vibration sensors, ESP32-based gateways, and CAN-bus integration with the IPETronik IPE833 logger. Built for precision agriculture, this project enables automatic detection of implement activity (idle vs active) and logs usage patterns for analytics, reporting, and predictive maintenance.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This system combines:
- **BLE vibration sensors (MSV01)** to detect implement activity.
- **ESP32 BLE-to-CAN gateway** using MCP2515 transceiver for message transmission.
- **IPE833 CAN logger** to record implement status with tractor data.
- **Cloud-based analysis** of usage trends, anomalies, and utilization reports.

## ðŸ“Š Use Case

Designed for smart farming machinery where knowing when and how long an implement is used can improve:
- Energy efficiency
- Fleet utilization
- Maintenance planning
- Operator behavior analysis
